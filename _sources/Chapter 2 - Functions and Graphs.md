Chapter 2 - Functions and Graphs
================================

In this chapter, we look at function, its properties, and applications. The concept of function evolved over time. The word "function" was applied differently by different mathematicians. It was first introduced by Rene Descartes in 1637. To him, a function was a positive integral power of a variable. Leibniz (1646-1716) used the word function to denote any quantity associated with a curve, such as the coordinates of a point on the curve. Euler (1707-1783) used the word to mean any equation or formula involving variables and constants. later, Dirichlet (1805-1859) described the function as a correspondence between two sets. This definition is used in the text - **Sullivan and Sullivan**.
